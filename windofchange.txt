I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An august summer night

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

(Refrain)
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
